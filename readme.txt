Allows developers to run secondary copies of WordPress sites that redirect non-developers to the main site. 

== Description ==
Allows developers to run secondary copies of WordPress sites that redirect non-developers to the main site. 

Useful for creating and managing development environments where regular visitors should not have access to 
the site, but the developer would like the ability to see theme or plugin changes before going live with them.
Also prevents development sites from being seen and spidered by search engines.
